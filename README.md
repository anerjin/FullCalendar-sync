# most of the code was from this example. I implemented obtaining calendar information

https://developers.google.com/+/quickstart/java


# Instructions:
#   1) go into fullcalendar-sync folder in terminal
#   2) javac -sourcepath src -d bin -classpath "lib/*" src/com/google/plus/samples/quickstart/Signin.java
#   3) java -classpath "bin:lib/*" com.google.plus.samples.quickstart.Signin
#   4) go to your browser and put localhost:4567
#   5) click on google+ button to authenticate
#   6) if page hasnt loaded reload the page, you'll see a button that says "Show your calendar in fullcalendar"
#   7) click "show your calendar in fullcalendar" button
